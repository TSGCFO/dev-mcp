# MCP Servers - Active Context

## What We're Working On Now
We're currently troubleshooting and fixing connection issues with the MCP servers. The servers were failing to connect properly due to issues with path configurations and command availability.

## Recent Changes
- Updated all Node.js-based MCP server configurations to use the full path to the Node.js executable (`C:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe`) instead of just `node`, as the command wasn't available in the PATH
- Fixed the fetch server configuration to use Python directly instead of the `uvx` command which wasn't available
- Stopped all existing Python and Node.js processes that might have been interfering with the servers

## Next Steps
1. Create the remaining Memory Bank files to document the system
2. Verify that the MCP servers can now connect properly
3. Test each server's functionality to ensure they're operating correctly
4. Document any additional issues found and fix them
