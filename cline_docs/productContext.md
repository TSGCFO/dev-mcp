# MCP Servers - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers provide a standardized way for AI assistants to communicate with external services and APIs. They extend the capabilities of AI systems by enabling them to access, modify, and interact with external data sources, applications, and services through a consistent protocol.

## Problems This Solves
- **Capability Extension**: Enables AI assistants to perform actions beyond their built-in capabilities
- **Standardization**: Provides a consistent interface for various external services
- **Security**: Creates controlled access points to external systems
- **Flexibility**: Allows new tools and resources to be added without changing the core AI system

## How It Should Work
The MCP servers function as middleware between AI assistants and external services:
1. AI assistant requests data or actions through the MCP protocol
2. MCP server authenticates and processes the request
3. MCP server communicates with the external service (e.g., email, database, file system)
4. Results are returned to the AI assistant in a standardized format

Each MCP server specializes in a specific domain (document handling, email, database access, etc.) and exposes its capabilities through tools and resources that the AI assistant can use when needed.
